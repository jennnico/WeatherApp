# WeatherApp

•	jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and HTML.

•	Uses geolocation to find your current location (latitude and longitude).

•	FreeCodeCamp weather API uses current location to give city name and current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and one descriptive word (e.g., snow)

•	Certain descriptive words prompt the function to display a corresponding icon (e.g. word 'snow' will display a snowflake), and will change the background color.

•	Character code 176 displays the degrees symbol.

Logic highlights:

•	User can toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius by clicking on the icon.

•	Default value is Celsius. Function uses that value to calculate degrees Fahrenheit.
